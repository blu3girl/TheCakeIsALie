# The Cake is a Lie

The Cake is a Lie is publised on itch.io at https://onewebdev.itch.io/cake-is-a-lie. With inspiration from Jackbox Games and Among Us, The Cake is a Lie is an interactive party game that supports multiplayer and various devices. 

### The Lore

Chef Broccoli needs your help to build a cake! Beware though, one person has been planted to put a slightly different ingredient into the mix. If it makes it in, everyone could be in trouble. Let's just say, you really shouldn't let the imposter mix in their ingredient.

### The game consists of:
- A Desktop Client developed using Unity/C#
- A Client-Side Web Application developed in Node.js, Socket.io, Tailwind, and Vue.js

Similar to Jackbox, the desktop client and web application communicate with each other and are both needed to play the game.

### This game was developed by a team of 4:

Nathan Reddy - Publicist 

Carolyn Nguyen - Unity Gameplay Developer

Dylan Theriot - Web Developer

Vivian Yu - Lead Designer
